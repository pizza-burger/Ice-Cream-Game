# Ice-Cream-Game
An ice cream game I created in 2015.

Created for a college Web Programming course project.
Collaborated with my friend and classmate Federico.

To play the game, download the entire repository as a .zip file and open projectHome.html in your favourite browser (Chrome is recommended). Instructions on the game are found in the .html.
